## Data

The DNR Deli, an awesome place, makes it difficult to directly link to specific data sets, and some data sets are not listed in the download section.  Their interface allows you to pick multiple datasets and bundle them together to download, but this is not helpful for linking to datasets.  Do note that by using this data, you do agree to their terms of use.

A list of datasets can be found from this [JS file](http://deli.dnr.state.mn.us/javascript/data_layer_def.js).
